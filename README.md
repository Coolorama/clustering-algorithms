You have been provided with a dataset named "cereal_activty.csv," which contains various attributes related to different cereal products.
Your task is to compare the performance of two clustering algorithms: OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify Clustering Structure) and DBSCAN 
(Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise).
